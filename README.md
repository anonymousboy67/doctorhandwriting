# 🖋️ Doctor Handwriting OCR (Handwritten Text Recognition)

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system** that extracts text from **handwritten doctor prescriptions** and images. It uses **Flask** for the backend and **React.js** with **Framer Motion** for the frontend, offering a clean UI and advanced text extraction features.  

## ✨ Features
✅ **Upload Image or Capture from Camera**  
✅ **Extract Handwritten Text using AI (TrOCR & Tesseract OCR)**  
✅ **Preprocessing Techniques (Blur, Contrast Adjustment, Noise Reduction)**  
✅ **Displays Extracted Text with Confidence Scores**  
✅ **Download Extracted Text as a File (Coming Soon!)**  
✅ **Dark Mode UI with Smooth Animations (Coming Soon!)**
